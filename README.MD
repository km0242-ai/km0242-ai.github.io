<title> What My Game Will Be About </title>
<ur/>
<p>
  I will be making an escape room game. My game will have multiple rooms, like:
  <ul>
    <li> key room </li>
    <li> locked door room </li>
    <li> wrong path forever room </li>
    <li> true ending </li>
  </ul>
The user will be able to click links to go to multiple rooms, each having their own pro's and con's. Some roms will lock you in there forever, others will get you till the end, and you will win, and some you will have to unlock by guessing the passcode.
